```assembly
mov eax, [ebp+8] ; Load the first argument
add eax, [ebp+12]; Add the second argument
mov [ebp-4], eax ; Store the result
```
This code snippet has a potential buffer overflow bug. If the sum of the two arguments exceeds the size of the allocated space at `[ebp-4]`, it will write beyond the allocated memory region, leading to unpredictable behavior or a program crash.
